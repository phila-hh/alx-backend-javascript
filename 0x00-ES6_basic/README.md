ES6, or ECMAScript 2015, is the sixth edition of the ECMAScript standard, bringing significant enhancements to the JavaScript programming language.

### 2. New Features Introduced in ES6

Explore the various new features introduced in ES6, such as:

- **Constants and Variables**: Understand the difference between constants and variables.

- **Block-scoped Variables**: Grasp the concept of variables scoped within blocks.

- **Arrow Functions**: Familiarize yourself with arrow functions and their default function parameters.

- **Rest and Spread Function Parameters**: Learn how to use rest and spread in function parameters.

- **String Templating**: Explore the string templating feature in ES6.

- **Object Creation and Properties**: Understand the updated methods of object creation and manipulation in ES6.

- **Iterators and for-of Loops**: Delve into iterators and the for-of loop for efficient looping.

### 3. Difference Between a Constant and a Variable

Differentiate between constants and variables, understanding their use cases and implications.

### 4. Block-scoped Variables

Comprehend the concept of block-scoped variables and how they contribute to code organization.

### 5. Arrow Functions and Function Parameters Default to Them

Master the usage of arrow functions and the default parameters associated with them.

### 6. Rest and Spread Function Parameters

Explore the flexibility and power brought by rest and spread in function parameters.

### 7. String Templating in ES6

Learn the syntax and benefits of string templating, enhancing string manipulation in your code.

### 8. Object Creation and Their Properties in ES6

Discover the streamlined methods of creating and managing objects in ES6.

### 9. Iterators and for-of Loops

Understand the role of iterators and leverage the simplicity of the for-of loop for iterating through collections.
