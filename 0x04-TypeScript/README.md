# TypeScript Project README

## Learning Objectives

Upon completion of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts confidently without relying on external sources:

### 1. Basic Types in TypeScript

Understand the fundamental data types in TypeScript, including but not limited to:

- **Primitive Types**: such as `number`, `string`, `boolean`.
- **Complex Types**: like `arrays` and `objects`.
- **Special Types**: such as `null` and `undefined`.

### 2. Interfaces, Classes, and Functions

Grasp the concepts of:

- **Interfaces**: Define and implement structured contracts for objects.
- **Classes**: Create reusable and maintainable object-oriented code.
- **Functions**: Explore the flexibility and type safety provided by TypeScript.

### 3. Working with the DOM and TypeScript

Learn how to interact with the Document Object Model (DOM) using TypeScript for enhanced web development.

### 4. Generic Types

Understand the power of generic types, enabling the creation of reusable and type-safe components.

### 5. Using Namespaces

Explore the organization and encapsulation of code through TypeScript namespaces.

### 6. Merging Declarations

Learn how TypeScript merges declarations and how this impacts code structure.

### 7. Using an Ambient Namespace to Import an External Library

Leverage ambient namespaces to seamlessly integrate external libraries into your TypeScript project.

### 8. Basic Nominal Typing with TypeScript

Understand the concept of nominal typing in TypeScript, enhancing type safety in your code.
